  - [ ] Characteristics of JavaScript
    - case-sensitive
    - **not** a type-safe language
    - looks a lot like C#, but has a number of differences
    - string literals can be wrapped in double or single quotes
    - string interpolation is performed with text inside a pair of back-ticks (`` ` ``)
      - placeholders in the form of `${expression}`
      - e.g.: `` `The count is` ${count}``
  - [ ] ***Variables***
  - [ ] The browser's dev tools provides a **console** that is a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) environment for JavaScript
  - [ ] Node also provides/is a REPL for JavaScript
  - [ ] Start [004](./src/004/ReadMe.md) (and review [its LOGs](./src/004/LOGs.md))
